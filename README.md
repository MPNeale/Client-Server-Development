# Client-Server-Development


    How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
    
    writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable is an important part of software development. it is useful to have programs that can be useed in multiple applications. this CRUD python module could be used for any application that connects to a MongoDB database.
    
    How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
    
    I approach problems step by step. I like to make sure that each requirement of the application works before moving on to the next. This process did not really differ from previous assignments or other courses. in the future if I need to create databases for other client requests, I would use a similar approach and make use of the python CRUD module.
    
    What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
    
    Computer scientists create and maintain software used by all types of companies to enable them to do their work better. Every business runs with some sort of software and there needs to be computer scientists and software developers to ensure that these softwares are running properly.
